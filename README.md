# Activity 05 - Algorithm Performance Analysis: Doubling Experiments

CMPSC101 :: Fall 2025 :: Modern Python Project with uv

**Assigned**: TBD
**Due**: TBD (Cut off due date and time).

Welcome to your first exploration of algorithm performance analysis using a modern Python development setup.

In this activity, you will conduct doubling experiments to measure how different algorithms perform as input sizes grow. You will run pre-written algorithms, measure their running times, and analyze the patterns you observe. This hands-on experience will give you intuition about algorithm efficiency while learning modern Python project management.

## Quick Start

**Run the program**:
```bash
uv run python src/main.py
```

Or use the convenient script command:
```bash
uv run activity05
```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Run timing experiments on different algorithms
* Observe how algorithm performance changes with input size
* Analyze experimental data to identify performance patterns
* Compare the efficiency of different algorithmic approaches
* Use doubling experiments to predict algorithm behavior

## What is a Doubling Experiment?

A **doubling experiment** is a method for analyzing algorithm performance by measuring running time as we systematically increase input size. We start with a base size N, then test with 2N, 4N, 8N, and so on.

### The Process

For each algorithm:

* Run experiments with doubling input sizes (N, 2N, 4N, 8N, ...)
* Measure the running time for each input size
* Calculate the ratio between consecutive measurements
* Identify patterns in these ratios

### Example Pattern Analysis

If an algorithm takes:

* 1 second for N=1000
* 2 seconds for N=2000  
* 4 seconds for N=4000
* 8 seconds for N=8000

The ratios are consistently 2:1, suggesting the algorithm has **linear growth** - doubling the input doubles the time.

## Algorithms We Will Analyze

### Search Algorithms

* **Linear Search**: Checks each element one by one until finding the target
* **Binary Search**: Divides the search space in half each step (requires sorted data)

### Sorting Algorithms  

* **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements that are in wrong order
* **Selection Sort**: Finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup Your Environment

This project uses **uv** for modern Python package management. All dependencies are automatically managed through the `pyproject.toml` file.

```bash
# Dependencies are automatically installed when you run:
uv run python src/main.py
```

### Step 2: Run the Interactive Experiments

The program will guide you through setting up your own custom experiment:

```bash
uv run activity05
```

The program will ask you to:

1. **Choose experiment sizes**: Pick from suggested ranges or enter your own custom sizes
   - Quick test: 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 (recommended for first time)
   - Medium test: 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000 (good balance)
   - Comprehensive: 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000 (takes longer)
   - Custom: Enter your own sizes separated by commas

2. **Select algorithms to test**:
   - Search algorithms only (Linear Search, Binary Search)
   - Sorting algorithms only (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)  
   - List operations only (Sum, Max, Min)
   - All algorithms (comprehensive)

### Step 3: Analyze Your Results

After running your experiments, the program will:

* Display timing results in formatted tables
* Show performance patterns and growth characteristics
* Create a visual plot of your results (if matplotlib is available)
* Generate a text-based visualization as backup
* Save results to `experiment_results.txt`

## Understanding the Results

### Linear Search Results

```
Size        Time (seconds)    Ratio
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
1000        0.000123         â”€
2000        0.000245         1.99
4000        0.000489         2.00
8000        0.000978         2.00
16000       0.001956         2.00
32000       0.003912         2.00

Pattern: Linear - doubling input doubles time
Growth pattern: Doubles when input doubles
```

**What this means**: Linear search has to check potentially every element, so doubling the list size doubles the worst-case time.

### Binary Search Results

```
Size        Time (seconds)    Ratio
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
1000        0.000008         â”€
2000        0.000009         1.13
4000        0.000010         1.11
8000        0.000011         1.10
16000       0.000012         1.09
32000       0.000013         1.08

Pattern: Logarithmic - small increase as input doubles
Growth pattern: Very slow increase as input doubles
```

**What this means**: Binary search eliminates half the possibilities each step, so it only needs a few more steps even when the input doubles.

### Sorting Algorithm Results

For bubble sort and selection sort, you should see ratios around 4:1, indicating that doubling the input quadruples the time (quadratic growth).

## Reflection Questions

After running your experiments, answer these questions in `writing/reflection.md`:

1. **Linear vs Binary Search**: How do the timing ratios compare between linear and binary search? Why do you think binary search performs better?

2. **Sorting Comparison**: Compare the performance of bubble sort and selection sort. Are they similar? What do the ratios tell you about their efficiency?

3. **Prediction**: Based on your bubble sort results, predict how long it would take to sort 64000 elements if 32000 elements took 2 seconds.

4. **Real-World Applications**: Think of three real-world scenarios where you would prefer binary search over linear search, and explain why.

5. **Limitations**: What are some limitations of these timing experiments? What factors might affect the accuracy of your measurements?
